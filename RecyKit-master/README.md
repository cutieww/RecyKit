This mobile application was built as the product for a hackathon over the span of 24 hours. This product won first place at the hackathon due to it's technical competency and the superiority of the idea.

This application was built upon the idea of many people not knowing whether certain items are recyclable or not. After conducting thorough research, it was apparent that there were a lot of people facing this problem with a large group of them willing to use this product in order to recycle better and consequently help the planet.

This mobile app essentially removes that ambiguity by incorporating two key aspects. The first aspect is by using product barcodes where the recyclability of a product is determined by crowd-sourcing. Essentially, a user would scan the barcode and depending on how many other people have voted on that product's recyclability - the app would inform the user what they should do after which the user has opportunity to vote regarding the product themselves.
The second aspect of the product is useful in the absence of a barcode or when the barcode/product has never been scanned by any other user. This aspect of the app determines the material used to build the product by using image recognition which uses a complex model trained using machine learning. Depending on the material of the product, the application would inform the user on whether they should RECYKIT OR NOT.
